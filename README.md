# HW-01-Refactoring-code

Welcome to my refactored code for Horiseon. The bulk of the refactoring took the form of giving class names to elements in the webpage with common css styling; this way I could use only 1 css styling form to style multiple elements. Additionally, I changed the name of the div's that contained the main site content to <main> tags, making it easier to interpret the html code. The last major change I made was to delete a lot of redundant css code which formatted elements the same way; I did this by adding classes.
